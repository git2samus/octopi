Dynamic topologies for streams of data.

## Intro

This is a proof-of-concept for a system that can dynamically create and manage running topologies for streams of data, able to connect command & control systems or data-processing pipelines.

The focus is on reliability and uptime, and the ability to alter a running system without stopping/restarting it. It's not meant to process high load or large volumes of data.
